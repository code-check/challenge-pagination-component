# Pagination Component
The goal of this challenge is to make a simple pagination component, normally used to provide pagination on large result lists.

### Information
- [index.html](/wwwroot/index.html)
 - Use the element `pagination` but do not edit the html of it.
 - Use `btnPrev` and `btnNext` for the backward and forward navigations.
 - Do not remove any of the existing `script` tags
- [index.js](./wwwroot/index.js)
 - You can freely use this file for any JavaScript code.
- [custom.css](./wwwroot/custom.css)
 - You can freely use this file for additional styling.

### Goal
The pagination component must pass the following rules;

- Only 5 items can be shown at a time, currently there are 20 items.
- The active item must have the `active` class.
- The hidden items must have the `hidden` class.
- `btnPrev` must be used for moving the active item 1 position backwards.
- `btnNext` must be used for moving the active item 1 position forward.
